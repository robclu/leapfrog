//! A concurrent hash table which uses leapfrog probing. This map is also lock-free
//! **if** the key and value support atomic operations. If not, an efficient spin-lock
//! is used instead.
//!
//! All operations on a [`LeapMap`] can be used concurrently with each other, and
//! the map is both fast and scalable up to many threads. The interface for the map
//! has been kept as close as possible to `std::collections::HashMap`, however,
//! there are some differences to ensure that concurrent operations are always correct
//! without decreasing performance.
//!
//! The biggest differences between the interface of the [`LeapMap`] and the
//! `std::collections::HashMap` are the types returned by `get` and `get_mut`.
//! For the [`LeapMap`], these methods return [`Ref`] and [`RefMut`] types,
//! respectively, whose interfaces are designed to allow for accessing the cells
//! returned by the those methods concurrently and correctly. As a result, it is
//! not possible to get a reference to a cell's value, since the cell value type
//! is atomic. The cell's key, value, and key-value pairs can be accessed with
//! `key`, `value`, and `key_value` methods, respectively for [`Ref`] and
//! [`RefMut`] types. For the [`RefMut`] type, the value can additionally be
//! modified with `set_value` or `update`. These interfaces ensure that the most
//! up to date value is loaded/stored/updated, and that if the referenced cell is
//! invalidated/updated/erased by other threads, the [`Ref`]/[`RefMut`] type is
//! updated appropriately. This makes working concurrently with the map simple,
//! without sacrificing performance.
//!
//! The map uses [leapfrog probing](https://preshing.com/20160314/leapfrog-probing/)
//! which is similar to [hopscotch hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_hashing)
//! since it is based off of it. Leapfrog probing stores two offset per
//! cell which are used to traverse a local neighbourhood of values
//! around the cell to which a key hashes. This makes the map operations cache
//! friendly and scalable, even under heavy contention. Keys are also stored,
//! and to allow the [`LeapMap`] to still be efficient the hash of a key is also
//! stored, which adds 8 bytes of overhead per key-value pair. This can very likely
//! be improved, but this map is still in its early stages. The [`LeapMap`] is
//! designed for performance so if memory efficiency is more important, a different
//! map is likely a better choice.
//!
//! # HashMap
//!
//! This crate also provides [`HashMap`], which is an fast single-threaded
//! version of the concurrent lock-free hash map, whose performance is roughly
//! 1.2-1.5x the hash map implementation in the standard library, when using the
//! same hash function. The tradeoff that is currently made to enable this performance
//! is increased memory use, since the map stores the offsets (8 bytes) and the
//! hashed value for a key (8 bytes). This may make the map unsuitable for some
//! use cases.
//!
//! # Hash Functions
//!
//! By default, the default hash function from the standard library is used for
//! both the [`HashMap`] and the [`LeapMap`], since it is DOS resistant. It is,
//! however, more expensive to evaluate. The [`MurmurHasher`] can be used instead,
//! which is quite a bit faster but which is **not** DOS resistant. Additionally, the
//! default initialization of the [`HashMap`] and [`LeapMap`] data requires that
//! 0 not be used as a key for the map *if the [`MurmurHasher`] is used*. With the
//! default hasher this limitation does not apply. Any other hash functions can
//! be used by creating the maps with `with_hasher` or `with_capacity_and_hasher`.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! This map has been benchmarked against other hash maps across multiple threads
//! and multiple workloads. The benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/robclu/conc-map-bench).
//! A snapshot of the results for a read heavy workload are the following (with
//! throughput in Mops/second, cores in brackets, and performance realtive to
//! `std::collections::HashMap` with RwLock). While these benchmarks show good
//! performance, **please take note of the limitations described above**, and
//! benchmark for your use case. Please also create an issue if there are either
//! correctness or performance problems for a specific use case. For a read heavy
//! workload on 16 cores the following was benchmarked:
//!
//! | Map              | Throughput (1) | Relative (1) | Throughput (16) | Relative (16) |
//! |------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
//! | RwLock + HashMap | 19.4           | 1.0          | 11.7            | 0.60          |
//! | Flurry           | 11.2           | 0.58         | 80.8            | 4.16          |
//! | DashMap          | 14.1           | 0.72         | 87.5            | 4.51          |
//! | LeapMap          | 17.8           | 0.92         | 148.0           | 7.62          |
//!
//! On an 12 core M2 Max, the results were the following:
//!
//! | Map              | Throughput (1) | Relative (1) | Throughput (12) | Relative (12) |
//! |------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
//! | RwLock + HashMap | 21.2           | 1.0          | 3.4             | 0.16          |
//! | Flurry           | 8.0            | 0.37         | 64.5            | 3.04          |
//! | DashMap          | 10.4           | 0.49         | 42.2            | 2.00          |
//! | Evmap            | 13.5           | 0.64         | 18.7            | 0.88          |
//! | LeapMap          | 13.9           | 0.66         | 106.1           | 5.00          |
//!
//! On an exchange heavy benchmark, the leapmap was even faster.
//!
//! The performance of the [`LeapMap`] is limited is when rapidly growing the map, since
//! the bottleneck then becomes the resizing (allocation) and migration operations.
//! The map **is not** designed to be resized often (resizing infrequently has very
//! little impact on performance, however), so it's best to use an initial capacity
//! which is close to the expected maximum number of elements for the map. The growing
//! performace is slightly worse than DashMap's growing performance (see the
//! benchmarks). If resizing is frequent, this map is currently not the best choice,
//! however, this can be improved by using a more efficient allocator.
//!
//! # Consistency
//!
//! All operations on a [`LeapMap`] map are non-blocking, and accessing/updating
//! a value in the map will not lock **if the value type has built-in atomic support**.
//! The map can be iterated (mutable or immutably) from multiple threads while
//! concurrently calling the operations directly on the map from other threads.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! Getting the length of the map does not return the length of the map, but rather an
//! estimate of the length, unless the calling thread is the only thread operating
//! on the map, and therefore there are no other readers or writers. Additionally,
//! the length is expensive to compute since it is not tracked as insertions and
//! removals are performed. The overhead of doing so when under contention
//! was found to be significant during benchmarking, and given that it's only an
//! estimate, it's not worth the cost.
//!
//! The same applies for `is_empty`.
//!
//! The size of the map must always be a power of two. This is handled internally
//! and may change in the future to improve memory efficiency.
//!
//! The value type for the map needs to implement the [`Value`] trait, which is
//! simple enough to implement, however, two values need to be chosen: one as a
//! null value and another as a redirect value. For integer types MAX and MAX-1
//! are used respectively. A good choice is values which are efficient for
//! comparison.
//!
//! # Resizing
//!
//! The buckets for the map are expanded when an insertion would result in a
//! offset which would overflow the maximum probe offset (i.e when it's not
//! possible to find an empty cell within the probe neighbourhood), or shrunk
//! when probes are too far apart. The resizing and subsequent removal of buckets
//! from the old table to the new table will happen concurrently when multiple
//! threads are attempting to modify the map, which makes the reszing
//! efficient. Despite this, it is best to choose a larger size where possible,
//! since it will ensure more stable performance of map operations. When the table
//! is resized, the old memory is cleanup up using what is essentially a quescient
//! based reclaimation strategy.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! There is optional support for serde, via the "serde" feature.
//!
//! # Usage with stable
//!
//! This crate requires the `allocator_api` feature, which is only available on nightly.
//! To enable use of the crate with the stable toolchain, the `"stable_alloc"` feature has
//! been added.
//!
//! If/when the `allocator_api` feature is no longer experimental, this feature flag will
//! be removed.
